# The Game of Life

Created as the final project for Cornell University CS 3110 (Data Structures and Functional Programming)

**Description**
This version of the Game of Life was made in OCaml and written throughout the Fall 2021 semester. This project contains a fully fledged game with all of the original game's rules and functions such as lawsuits, buying houses, and more. Our main focuses were writing good code as well as documenting our code properly, and test-driven development.
